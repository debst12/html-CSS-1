    <h3>1. Realism or fantasy?</h3>

    <p>
        JRR Tolkien’s daughter said that she believes her father’s description of the Dead Marshes, a treacherous bog littered with thousands of corpses, is actually a description of his experience in World War I.

    <h3>2. Fellows… But From A Distance</h3>

    <p>
        Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood never filmed a scene together in person. “I never worked with Elijah Wood,” McKellen confessed. “He was the main part in Lord of the Rings, but he’s smaller than me, so we could never be together.”
        
        Shows how good their acting really was. Could you have guessed they weren’t ever in the same room?

    <h3>3. Whoops…</h3>

    <p>
    Sean Connery turned down the role of Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings trilogy because he had never read the books and “didn’t understand the script.”

    It wasn’t exactly a smart career move. At the time he was offered 15% of gross profits, which would have net him about $400 million (more than any other actor has ever been paid for a single role).

    <h3>4. Nicolas Cage, King of Gondor</h3>

    <p>
        Nicolas Cage passed on the role of Aragorn because of “family obligations.” Daniel Day-Lewis also turned down the role.

    <h3>5. No Wings For Sean</h3>

    <p>
        Great swaths of The Lord of the Rings was filmed in the mountains of New Zealand. Mountains which, due to their immense height and craggy terrain, could only be accessed by air. But actor Sean Bean (who played Boromir) refused to fly—leaving him only one option for travel…
        
        Even for the scenes set on mountains, Bean hiked to set in Boromir’s full suit of armor.
